WWCNT's Summer Game!

You awake in a mysterious world. Nearby, a boy wearing a fox mask warns you that if you do not collect all 10 of the pumpkins scattered across the world, you will be trapped there forever.

You thus set out on your small scaveneger hunt journey in order to escape from the world!
